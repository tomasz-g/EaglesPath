			<h2>Orla PerÄ‡</h2>
			<p><span><abbr title="translation from Wikipedia.org">Eagle's Path</abbr></span>
			is a tourist path in the Tatra Mountains in southern Poland. 
			It is the longest and the most difficult and dangerous public path in the entire Tatras,
			which led through slopes and abroad through the passes and peaks. On the trail there are 
			chains, buckles and 2 steel ladders to make it easier, but nevertheless trail is not 
			suitable for novice hikers. Requires some familiarity with the mountains, way to use 
			chains, and finally the ability to search for competent tricks and degrees. This is 
			especially important in bad weather. Numerous exhibitions on the route are relatively 
			strong, so the trail is discouraged for people with a fear of heights.		
			Is therefore a suitable route only for experienced climbers, since it was established, 
			<strong>more than 120 people have lost their lives on the route.</strong></p>
